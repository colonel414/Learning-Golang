My first program will print the classic “hello world” message

To run the program, use `$ go run hello-world.go` .

Sometimes we’ll want to build our programs into binaries. We can do this using go build.

`$ go build -o hello-world hello-world.go`

```
$ ls
hello-world    hello-world.go
```
We can then execute the built binary directly.
